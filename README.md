# Flutter LUCI Service Configurations

Contains configuration and tools related to Flutter's build infrastructure.

Configuration is generated by `lucicfg`, which is part of `depot_tools`. Rather
than updating the individual .cfg files, updates should be made to
`config/main.star`. That file can then be run to regenerate the configuration.

## Forcing the propagation of these configurations

Configuration changes are read by the LUCI Configuration Service from
[a gerrit mirror](https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/flutter/infra/)
of this repo. Both the github -> googlesource mirroring and luci-config reading
updated changes happen as scheduled tasks. Once a change has reached the
mirror, one may speed up the propagation of the new configuration files by visiting the
[luci-config web ui](https://luci-config.appspot.com/), logging in, and
searching for projects/flutter. from there, one may click on the
projects/flutter search result and click the download icon to force an update.
